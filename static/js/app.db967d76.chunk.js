Reposition your hands and knees as necessary so that your knees are directly under your hips and hands are directly under your shoulders."},{"key":"3","step":"Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles to position your spine in a neutral position, avoid any excessive sagging or arching."},{"key":"4","step":" Upward Phase: This exercise involves simultaneous movement of your leg and contralateral (opposite) arm. This exercise is best performed facing a mirror. Hip Extension: Slowly extend your left hip (raise and straighten the knee) attempting to extend it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any rotation in the hip. Your goal is to keep both hips parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the hips, parallel to the waistline of your pants, provides visual feedback to hip rotation and what corrections are needed."},{"key":"5","step":"Shoulder flexion: Slowly flex your right arm (raise and straighten the arm) attempting to raise it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any tilting at the shoulders. Your goal is to keep the both shoulders parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the shoulders provides visual feedback to shoulder rotation and what corrections are needed. Your head should remain aligned with the spine throughout the movement."},{"key":"6","step":"The degree of hip extension and shoulder flexion is determined by the ability to control against movement in the low back. As the leg is raised, individuals may witness an increase in lumbar lordosis (low back sagging). Only raise the limbs to heights where the low back position can be maintained through the combined actions of the core and abdominal muscles."},{"key":"7","step":"Downward Phase: Gently lower yourself back to your starting position and repeat with the opposite limbs."}]},{"key":"1","name":"Bodyweight Squat","instructions":[{"key":"1","step":"Starting Position: Begin standing with your feet slightly wider than hip-width, with the toes turned slightly outwards with your hands by your sides so the palms facing inwards.

Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, shift your weight back into your heels while pushing your hips towards the wall behind you."},{"key":"3","step":"Downward Phase: Start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your hips and knees simultaneously. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Maintain tension in the core muscles (continue bracing) and attempt to keep your back flat."},{"key":"4","step":"Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel with the floor, until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees, ensuring that the feet don\'t move, the ankles do not collapse in or out and the knees remain aligned over the second toe."},{"key":"5","step":"From the Lowered Position: the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe and body weight should be evenly distributed between the balls and heels of the feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding."},{"key":"6","step":"Upward Phase: While maintaining your back, chest and head-up position, exhale and extend the hips and knees by pushing your feet into the floor through your heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Continue extending until you reach your starting position.

Reposition your hands as needed to allow full extension of your body from the knees without any bend at the hips. Stiffen your torso by contracting your core and abdominal muscles (bracing)."},{"key":"3","step":"Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase. Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the mat or floor. Your elbows should remain close to the sides of your body or flare outwards slightly."},{"key":"4","step":"Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine.
